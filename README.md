## **Overview**  
Delulu Solulu is the solution to your delusions! Have a Zoom crush? Or just nervous for an online interview? We've got you covered! Simply use this filter that turns your video call into a dating sim! 

## Foreword
This project was created during the Hack&Roll 2025 hackathon hosted by NUS Hackers. We're a team of 3 JC grads that had the opportunity to attend a CS1 course and just started learning python a month before the hackathon à¹‘(Â° Ð”Â°"à¹‘). We entered the hackathon to have fun, and also put our new skills to the test, although 99% of the coding we had to do was outside of what we learnt in the course ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. The whole hackathon was really exciting and fun, and we even got to experience firsthand what it felt to be cold, homeless smelly CS students(no joke it was freezing both inside and outside and we decided to sleep on the benches outside the dining hall where the hackathon was being held à²¥_à²¥). We're proud of what we were able to accomplish in those 24 hours and to have an actual working final productãƒ¾(â‰§âˆ‡â‰¦)ã‚ž. Our goal was to create something funny and useless, and through this project, weâ€™ve learned a lot more about Python, audio processing, APIs, and much more. We hope you enjoy using(don't use it) this filter as much as we enjoyed building it!

## **Inspiration**
A random tweet by a random japanese guy. Peak humour. Captions: "You... are such an interesting woman. Come to me (My company)."

## **Challenges & Learnings**  
- We wanted to implement a blush filter and kept running into issues, but we didn't give up until the last minuteï¼ˆï¾‰ï½¡â‰§â—‡â‰¦ï¼‰ï¾‰. Alas, it still couldn't work properly so we decided to forgo it (à²¥ Ì¯ à²¥). RIP Blush, we'll always remember youðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”.
- Working with PyQt5 for GUI development
- Working with Gemini's API and chat completions for romantic text generation
- Using Krita to photoshop UI designs
- Using Python's speechrecognition and an audio repeater to process audio
